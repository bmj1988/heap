  <meta property="og:description" content="Heap is an online auction site with tweaks for metal trading. I developed the idea for the project before learning how to code, as it was an extension of the trading work I do every day. The project is deployed through a docker image and uses JavaScript, React, AWS S3 image hosting as well as a host of dependencies mostly for auth. Heap has most of its functionality available directly through widgets on the splash page and uses lazy loading of partitioned components as well as lean querying to improve performance. This project was my Capstone for App Academy and it was mandatory to develop a web app, however the original idea was conceived of as a mobile platform, and porting it to mobile is my next planned step in development." />
